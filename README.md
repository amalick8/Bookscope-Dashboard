## üéØ Project Overview

This dashboard explores the magical world of *Harry Potter* through data. It fetches 50 books using the OpenLibrary API and displays them in a searchable, filterable list. The dashboard includes key summary stats, making it easy to understand patterns in the data (like how many books exist and when most were published).

## üß† How It Works

1. The app fetches 50 *Harry Potter* books using the OpenLibrary API  
2. Results are stored in React state (`useState`)  
3. `useEffect` loads the data asynchronously  
4. Users can:
   - Type in the **search bar** to filter by title/author  
   - Select a **decade filter** (1990s, 2000s, etc.)  
5. Summary stats update dynamically as filters change  
6. The app uses `.map()` and `.filter()` for rendering and filtering
